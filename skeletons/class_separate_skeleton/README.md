# Class Separate Skeleton

This project implements a basic layout of a C++ Class component with a custom separation of constants, data types, methods and attributes in separate files for a better code structure and maintainability. To be used as starting code for development of new class components.

## Provides

- Out of the box code to start development of new C++ class component.

- Separated code structure and sections for the different elements of the class into specific class files (constants, data types, attributes and methods).

- Focus on component elements isolation by using namespaces and class internal elements.

## Build

A Makefile is provided to build the project.

Simply run make to build it:

```bash
make
```

The output binary, named as "my_app", will be placed inside a "bin" directory, and also copied to project root location.
