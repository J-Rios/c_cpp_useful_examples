# Class Skeleton

This project implements the basic layout of a C++ Class component with a custom separation of sections in both, the class interface and implementation. To be used as starting code for development of new class components.

## Provides

- Out of the box code to start development of new C++ class component.

- Separated code structure and sections for the different elements of the class (constants, data types, attributes and methods).

- Focus on component elements isolation by using namespaces and class internal elements.

## Build

A Makefile is provided to build the project.

Simply run make to build it:

```bash
make
```

The output binary, named as "my_app", will be placed inside a "bin" directory, and also copied to project root location.
